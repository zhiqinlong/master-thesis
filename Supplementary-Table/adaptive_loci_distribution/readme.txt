Characteristics of adaptive variants. 
(a) Mapping the location of the 19,995 core adaptive variants across whole-genome. 
(b) Enrichment of various functional categories in adaptive variants (red dots). Grey dots show the distribution of results with 10,000 bootstrap replicates in neutral 
variants. The dashed line shows the expected enrichment under the null hypothesis of no enrichment. The significance is assessed by permutation test, with the significant enrichment being denoted by 
asterisks
